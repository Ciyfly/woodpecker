  name: WSO2 API Manager <=3.1.0 - Blind XML External Entity Injection
  author: lethargynavigator
  severity: critical
  description: WSO2 API Manager 3.1.0 and earlier is vulnerable to blind XML external entity injection (XXE). XXE often allows an attacker to view files on the server file system, and to interact with any backend
    or external systems that the application itself can access which allows the attacker to transmit sensitive data from the compromised server to a system that the attacker controls.
